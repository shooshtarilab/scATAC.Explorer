Description: 
    This package provides a tool to search and download a collection of publicly available single cell
    ATAC-seq datasets and their metadata. scATAC-Explorer aims to act as a single 
    point of entry for users looking to study single cell ATAC-seq data. 
    Users can quickly search available datasets using the metadata table and download
    datasets of interest for immediate analysis within R.
